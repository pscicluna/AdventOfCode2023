# AdventOfCode2023
 A repository for AoC 2023!

This is really just for me to keep track of what I'm doing. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do this every day, but I'll try my best!

I'm doing everything in Python first, and then if I have time I'll try to do the challenges in other languages. 
Hopefully, I'll be able to use AoC to brush up on C++ and/or Julia, and maybe even learn a new language like Rust.
